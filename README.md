What have I programmed?

This code helps you organize your computer files by moving them to different folders based on their type.

Let's say you have a bunch of pictures, music, videos, and documents on your computer, but they're all in one messy folder. This code will help you move those files to different folders depending on what type of file they are.

For example, if you have a picture of a cute puppy, this code will recognize it as an image and move it to a folder called "Images". If you have a video of a birthday party, it will recognize it as a video and move it to a folder called "Videos".

The code works by checking each file's name and extension to see what type of file it is. Then, it moves that file to the appropriate folder.

The code also includes support for different file types such as images, videos, audio, and documents. It can even distinguish between sound effects and music files, and move them to separate folders.

The code also includes a function to make sure that there are no files with the same name in the destination folder. If there is already a file with the same name, it will add a number to the end of the new file's name to make it unique.

Lastly, the code uses a logging function to keep track of which files have been moved and to where. This can be helpful if you want to keep track of what files have been organized.


Why did I build it?

This code was created out of necessity when I transferred hundreds of pictures and videos from my phone to my computer, and was faced with the daunting task of organizing them manually. The manual process was not only time-consuming, but also prone to human error. To solve this problem, I leveraged my programming skills and created this code to automate the process of organizing these files based on their type (e.g., images, videos, documents, audio files, etc.) and move them to their respective destination folders.

By automating the process with this code, I not only saved a significant amount of time but also ensured that the files were sorted and stored in their respective folders accurately, reducing the risk of human error. This is a great example of how programming can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently and effectively.
